### About GNOME Foundation

The GNOME Foundation, creators of the GNOME Project, GTK, Flatpak, and other open source technologies, is a non-profit organization that works to create a computing platform for use by the general public that is composed entirely of free software.

<b>NOTE: </b>

### Before Start Contributing

Before getting into the open source world you must learn Git, GitHub or GitLab, and atleast basics of one programming language. 

Here are brief information about Git and GitHub:

- <b>Git</b> is a distributed version control system. This means that you can have a copy of your Git repository on your own computer, as well as on GitHub. This is useful for working offline and for collaborating with others.
- <b>GitHub</b> is a web-based platform. This means that you can access your Git repositories from anywhere with an internet connection. GitHub also provides a variety of tools and features that make it easy to collaborate on projects.

If you wanted to contribute to the open-source projects, I highly recommend learning about Git and GitHub. They are essential tools for working with code.

### Okay, let's start

Here are steps to deep dive into open-source contribution into GNOME projects.

##### Step 1: Choose a Tech Stack

Since the core GNOME libraries are written in C this means that C is the “default” platform language, but it is possible to use multiple languages to write applications for GNOME.
Currently <b>C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Vala</b> languages are used apart from <b>C</b> to write GNOME applications. 
So choose one language from the list and get some basic knowledge about [GTK](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/index.html), [GObject](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/), and [Adwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/index.html).

In summary, GTK is a toolkit for building GUIs, GObject is an object-oriented system used by GTK and other GNOME libraries, and Adwaita is the default GTK theme providing a consistent visual style within the GNOME desktop environment. 

Here is the table that contains documentations of different languages and it's bindings with GTK.([source](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/introduction/languages.html))

| Language | Documentation |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| C++  | [gtkmm](https://gtkmm.org/en/index.html)  |
| JavScript  | [GJS](https://gjs.guide/), [API references](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/)  |
| Python  | [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [API references](http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/)  |
| Rust  | [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/), [Book](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/)  |
| Vala  | [Vala](https://vala.dev/), [API references](https://valadoc.org/)  |


##### Step 2: Choose a Project

GNOME has tons of projects which are available at GitLab.

##### Step 3: Build the Project

##### Step 4: Getting in Touch with GNOME Community

### Additional Resources

### GSoC and Outreachy

### GNOME Events
