#### About GNOME Foundation

The GNOME Foundation, creators of the GNOME Project, GTK, Flatpak, and other open source technologies, is a non-profit organization that works to create a computing platform for use by the general public that is composed entirely of free software.

#### Before Start Contributing

Before getting into the open source world you must learn Git, GitHub, and atleast basics of one programming language. 

Here are brief information about Git and GitHub:

- <b>Git</b> is a distributed version control system. This means that you can have a copy of your Git repository on your own computer, as well as on GitHub. This is useful for working offline and for collaborating with others.
- <b>GitHub</b> is a web-based platform. This means that you can access your Git repositories from anywhere with an internet connection. GitHub also provides a variety of tools and features that make it easy to collaborate on projects.

If you wanted to contribute to the open-source projects, I highly recommend learning about Git and GitHub. They are essential tools for working with code.
