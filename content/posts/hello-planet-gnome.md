<b>Hey, Everyone!</b> 

I'm Gotam Gorabh, a Computer Science & Engineering student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam, India.
I want to thank GNOME and my mentor Felipe Borges for giving me the incredible opportunity to contribute to the GNOME Settings project.

<b>About My GSoC Project</b>

This summer Iâ€™ll be working on <b>Creating a New "System" panel into the GNOME Settings</b> under the mentorship of Felipe Borges. 
By Creating a new system panel will provide users with a unified interface for managing various settings. we can achieve it by merging Date & Time, Users, Region & Language, and About panels, and Implementing a Remote Desktop page into the system panel. 
It will provide a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for GNOME users.

The following tasks are to be done this summer...


- [ ] Add New Empty System Panel to Panel List (<b>week 1</b>)
- [ ] Add Region & Language Page into the System Panel (<b>week 2 & week 3</b>)
- [ ] Add Date & Time Page into the System Panel (<b>week 4 & week 5</b>)
- [ ] Add About Page into the System Panel (<b>week 6</b>)
- [ ] Add Users Page into the System Panel (<b>week 7, week 8 & week 9</b>)
- [ ] Add Remote Desktop Page into the System Panel (<b>week 10</b>)
- [ ] Discussion on adding the unit test cases and Eliminating errors (<b>week 11</b>)
