#### Introduction

In simple terms, Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a tool that helps you manage and organize multiple command-line sessions within a single terminal window. 
It allows you to work on different tasks simultaneously, switch between them easily, and keep them running even if you close the terminal or disconnect from a remote server.
